Weather App Rebuild
Rebuilt my original weather app design in NextJS using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It is responsive for desktop and mobile screen resolutions.
Peer review: Sebastian Breve-Sanchez
Peer review comments: The weather website is fully functional. The design is quite pleasing, with mobile responsiveness working as intended. All the data that is needed is populating correctly. The only criticism is to the code, and how there are two useEffects that are constantly refreshing. Using bools or functions might be able to negate that. Other than that, good job.
